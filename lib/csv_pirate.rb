  #                  (swag OR spyglasses can be specified, but code defers to swag if provided)
  #   :spyglasses => is the column to load ("find_by_#{booty}") the ARrr object for each row on the first CSV
  #                  (swag OR spyglasses can be specified, but code defers to swag if provided)
  #   :waggoner   => where the capn's loot was stashed (filename)
  #   :chart      => directory where capn's waggoner is located

  #   :grub       => is the class on which to make booty [method] calls, or 
  #                    is a method (as a string) we call to get from the object loaded by capn,
  #                    to the object on which we'll make the first_mate booty [method] calls, or nil, if same object
  #   :swag       => is the method to call on first CSV row's object to find second CSV row's object (if grub is a class)
  #   :spyglasses => is the column to load ("find_by_#{booty}") the ARrr object for each row on the second CSV (if grub is a class)
  #   :booty      => is the methods to call on the ARrr object for each row on the second CSV
